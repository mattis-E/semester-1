# Week 1.3, Session 1: For loop equivalent to a list comprehension

animals = ['dog','cat','hamster','goldfish']

not_fish = [item for item in animals if item != 'goldfish']

not_fish_2 = []
for a in animals:
    if a != "goldfish":
        not_fish_2.append(a)

print(not_fish)
print(not_fish_2)


# write the equivalent for loop to create the not_fish list from animals
# print your result to verify it is the same
